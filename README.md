# Hands-on introduction to protein modeling (3 h)


## Course Disclaimer

This brief instruction booklet contains the materials for the "Hands-on Protein Modeling" sessions I lectured at the [CIVIS Summer School Bioinformatics for non-bioinformaticians](https://civis.eu/en/civis-courses/bioinformatics-for-non-bioinformaticians-computational-analyses-in-health-and-life-sciences), TÃ¼bingen, Germany (18-22 July 2022).

Most of the materials are shared with the course *Structural Bioinformatics* that I teach in the [Master's Degree in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology \@UAM](https://www-uam-es.translate.goog/Medicina/MasterBioinformaticaBiologiaComputacional/1446820907497.htm?language=es&nodepath=M?ster+Universitario+en+Bioinform?tica+y+Biolog?a+Computacional&_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp). The contents are also largely inspired in the works of others that shared their course materials, tips and other kind of resources on their own websites, GitHub or Twitter, including Alexandre Bovin, Sergey Ovchinnikov, Martin Steinegger, Carlos Outeiral, among many others. I tried to acknowledge each contribution and I apologize beforehand for those that I may have not mention.

You can reach me by [email](mailto::modesto.redrejo@uam.es) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mredrejo "Twitter"). Please let me know if you find some missing reference. I will also appreciate any suggestion or correction.

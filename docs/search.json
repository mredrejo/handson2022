    "text": "Structural Bioinformatics is a broad discipline that covers structural and computational biology, from visualization and analysis of the structure of biomacromolecules to protein modeling and molecular docking. Powered by great technical advances, the field has experienced a great revolution in the last decade. The increase of experimental capacities to analyze the structure of proteins and other biological molecules and structures (see Callaway (2020)) and the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted structure prediction boosted the capacity of life-science researchers to address a wide variety of questions regarding proteins diversity, evolution and function. The implications of this revolution in biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine are still unforeseen.\n\nFor a short introductory course on protein modeling, I propose the following three basic objectives:\n\nIdentify the main applications and limitations of the prediction of protein structures in biomedicine and biotechnology.\nBecome familiar with classic and state-of-the-art protein modeling methods.\nBasic understanding of the resulting output of a protein modeling experiment and how to evaluate and eventually improve the model quality."

Source: https://swissmodel.expasy.org/static/course/files/PartIII_quality_assesment.pdf\n\n\nThe surrealist Belgian painter René Magritte created a collection of surrealistic paintings entitled La trahison des images (1928–1929). The most renowned of those paintings show a smoking pipe and the following caption underneath: “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” (This is not a pipe). Yes, indeed! It is actually the painting of a pipe.\nSimilarly, a picture of a protein, or a PDB file with the coordinates of a protein structure, is not a protein. It is a representation of ONE structure. Even experimentally determined structures have two main limitations that we should always keep in mind: (1) they are a fixed structure whereas proteins in vivo are flexible and dynamic and (2) they are subjected to experimental error and they often contain regions of low reliability. Moreover, even experimentally obtained macromolecular structures are to some degree models, with a variable ratio between experimental data and computational prediction to match the experimental data (X-ray diffraction, cryo-EM density maps, NMR, SAXS, FRET…) with previously known structures or prediction models. That does not mean that protein structures are useless, they can be very useful, but we must be aware of the limitations as well as the applications."

    "text": "The number of protein sequences in databases growth exponentially during the last decades, particularly after the revolution of high throughput sequencing methods.\n\n\n\nNumber of entries in UniProt/TrEMBL (release 2022_2).\n\n\nHowever, experimental determination of 3D protein structures is often difficult, time-consuming, and subjected to limitations, such as experimental error, data interpretation and modeling new data on previously released structures. Thus, despite substantial efforts that started at the beginning of the 21st century to implement high-throughput structural biology methods (see for instance Manjasetty et al. (2008)), the availability of protein structures is more than 1,000 times less than the number of sequences (231,354,261 sequences for Uniprot and 192,489 structures in RCSB Protein Databank in 2022). This difference is called the protein structure gap and it is constantly widening (Muhammed and Aki-Yalcin (2019)).\n\n\n\nNumber of macromolecular structures in RCSB PDB database (accessed 6th July 2022).\n\n\nThus, an accurate prediction of the 3D structure of any given protein is needed to make up for the lack of experimental data.\n\n\nAmino acid properties determine the phi and psi angles that eventually shape the higher structural levels. Protein folding might be more complex though, as it should be coupled to protein synthesis.\nIn 1968, Cyrus Levinthal (1922–1990) published the so-called Levinthal’s paradox, stating that proteins fold in nano/milliseconds, but even for small peptides it will take a huge time to test the astronomical number of possible conformations. Say a 100 aa small protein; it will have 99 peptidic bonds and 198 different phi and psi angles. Assuming only 3 alternative conformations for each bond, it will yield 3198 (= 2.95 x 1095) possible conformations. If we design a highly efficient algorithm that tests 1 conformation per nanosecond:\n 2.95 x 1085 secs = 9x1067 billions years\nConsidering that the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years, predicting protein structures does not seem an easy task.\nIn this context, roughly 50 years ago, a very simple experiment led some light on the protein folding mechanism. Cristian Anfisen was able to completely denature (unfold) the Ribonuclease A, by the addition of reducing agents and urea under heat treatment, and subsequently switch to normal conditions that allow the protein to re-fold fully functional. This experiment indicates that the amino acid sequence dictates the final structure. Notwithstanding some relevant exceptions, this has been largely confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anfinsen Dogma: Amino acid sequence dictated the final structure. From Anfinsen (1973) .\n\n\nOne can imagine that in vivo native structures of proteins look-alike the lowest free energy conformation, i.e., the global energy minimum. That is the basis of the funnel model of protein folding, which assumes that the number of possible conformations is reduced when a local energy minimum is achieved, constituting a path for the folding process.\n\n\n\nSchematic diagram of a protein folding energy landscape according to the funnel model. Denatured molecules at the top of the funnel might fold to the native state by a myriad of different routes, some of which involve transient intermediates (local energy minima) whereas others involve significant kinetic traps (misfolded states). From .\n\n\nIn conclusion, prediction of protein structures is possible, as protein folding relies only on the protein sequence, but it will require virtually infinite time and computational resources.\nHomology modeling is one of the easiest tricks to bypass that limitation. Basically, the strategy is adding all the possible extra information to the amino acid properties, namely the evolutionary conservation of sequences and structures.\nVery often, before generating models you already have some information about your protein. For instance, if it is an enzyme you may have spotted the catalytic residues or substrate-interaction region. It is also advisable to check the literature, particularly if there is a companion paper of the related PDB structure(s) that may be available or that you can eventually find and use as the template(s) for modeling."

    "text": "3.1 Step 1+2. Template search and align.\n\n3.1.0.1 Where can we search?\nTemplate searching consists in finding a protein with known structure that has a sequence similar to our protein. As we mentioned above, the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the largest database of protein structures, so we can search templates by comparing the sequence of our protein with the sequence of all the proteins in PDB. However, PDB was constructed to contain all the macromolecular structures, not for searching templates for modeling. Similar to other end-to-end software, SWISS-MODEL has its own curated database, called SMLT (SWISS-MODEL template library). This is based on PDB, updated weekly, and also annotated and indexed to boost searches. As of 6 July 2022, SMLT contains 133,049 unique protein sequences that map to 332,864 biological units (protein structures classified by their quaternary structure).\nNow, you first need your sequences. A protein sequence database like Uniprot or NCBI Protein, is a good place for this task.\nIf you want to cheat yourself, I give you the HAdV-2pol and NEIL2 sequences.\n\n\n3.1.0.2 How can we search accurately and fast?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery-template alignment is the base for homology modeling (Kelley (2009a))\n\n\nFinding templates require comparing sequences, thus an accurate and powerful alignment method is essential. Comparing one protein sequence with a whole database is time-consuming, as you will compare with totally unrelated proteins, which is a loss of resources. Two basic improvements increased the template search capacity, (1) the introduction of secondary structure (SS) by comparing SS predictions of the query protein and the secondary structures of the protein database, and (2) the use of profiles to make easier the comparison. Profiles are a mathematical way to summarize a multiple sequence alignment in which the frequency of each amino acid at each position is quantified. This allows the identification of highly conserved positions that not only define the protein function but also the fold. For instance, glycines at the end of each beta-strand or a pattern of polar residues that favor alpha-helices. A previous comparison of the query sequence with a database of sequences will allow us to include evolutionary information about it. Therefore, we moved from a requirement of >30% identity to obtain good models before the implementation of profiles, to good models even with ⁓20% identity or below. Moreover, the generation of profiles also facilitates clustering of the search database, reducing search time. The implementation of these capacities led to the implementation of the so-called fold recognition in homology modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom sequence vs. sequence search to profile-profile comparison (Kelley (2009b))\n\n\nTemplate searches in SWISS-MODEL are carried out with HHblits (Remmert et al. (2011)), a specific profile-profile method. We could search for templates also with Blast or other profile-profile methods, like Psi-BLAST, HHPred, or JackHMMER. Then templates are ranked by two different parameters, GMQE (global model quality estimate) and QSQE (quaternary structure quality estimate). Briefly, GMQE uses probability functions to assess several properties of the target-template alignment (sequence identity, sequence similarity, HHblits score, the agreement between predicted secondary structure of target and template, the agreement between predicted solvent accessibility between target and template; all normalized by alignment length) to predict the expected quality of the resulting model. QSQE assesses the oligomeric state probability of the model.\nNow, paste your sequences and click on Search.\nNote: If you click on “Build Model”, it will directly use the top-ranked template, so you’ll miss some fun, but you can go back for that later on if you change your mind.\n\n\n\nSWISS-MODEL modeling start\n\n\nBefore building the models, could you foresee which of our queries will give rise to a better model? Why?"

    "text": "3.2 Step 3. Model Building.\nBy default, SWISS-MODEL will provide 50 ranked possible templates. The output also contains information about the method and resolution of the templates, the % of identity (and alignment coverage) with the query sequence, and the GMQE and QSQE.\nThe top template is marked by default and it likely will give the best model, but it is also interesting to try some alternative templates depending on the downstream application of the model (see below). For instance with a different substrate/cofactor that can have a key role in the protein function or with different coverage or % identity.\nOnce the template(s) is selected, model coordinates are constructed based on the alignment of the query and template sequence. SWISS-MODEL uses a fragment assembly, as well as RosettaCM, another very well-known homology modeling algorithm by the Baker lab, implemented in Rosetta software and the Robetta server. Other programs, like Modeller, are based in the satisfaction of spatial restraints Janson et al. (2019).\nFragment assembly will use the template core backbone atoms to build a core structure of the model, leaving non-conserved regions (mostly loops) for later. Then, it will find compatible fragments in a dedicated loop database and also use ab initio building or missing loops.\n\n\n\nBackbone and loop modeling. From [Expasy Protein Structure, Comparative Protein Modelling, and Visualisation](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/course)\n\n\nThen, side chain of non conserved amino acids in undertook. The goal is findig the most likely side chain conformation, using template structure information, rotamer libraries (from known protein structures) and energetic and packaging criteria. If many side chains have to be placed in the structure it will lead to a “chicken and egg problem”. Thus, the more residues correctly positioned, the best model. That means that identification of hydrogen bonds between residues side chains and between side chains and the backbone reduce the optimization calculations.\n\n\n\nSide chain modeling. From [CMBI Seminars on Bioinformatics](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/teach/B1SEM/B1SEM_8.html)\n\n\nFinally, a short energy minimization is carry out to reduce the unfavorable contacts and bonds by adapting the angle geometries and relax close contacts. This energy minimization step or refinement can be useful to achieve better models but only when the folding is already accurate."

(2020)), a single parameter that combines statistical potentials and agreement terms with a distance constraints (DisCo) to provide a consensus score. DisCo evaluates consistencies of pairwise CA-CA distances from a model with constraints extracted from homologous structures. All scores are combined using a neural network trained to predict per-residue scores.\n\n\n\nHAdV-2 DNA polymerase model obtained with SWISS-MODEL.\n\n\nQMEANDisCo can be used to analyze models obtained with other methods in order to make them comparable.

The use of models entails a precaution and a need for experimental validation. However, knowing the limitations of our model is required for a realist use of it; and limits are defined by the model quality.\nThe accuracy of a comparative model is related to the percentage sequence identity on which it is based. High-accuracy comparative models can have about 1-2 Å root mean square (RMS) error for the main-chain atoms, which is comparable to the accuracy of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure or an x-ray structure. These models can be used for functional studies and the prediction of protein partners, including drugs or other proteins working in the same process.\nOn the contrary, low-accuracy comparative models are based on less than 20-30% sequence identity, hindering the modeling capacity and accuracy. Some of these models can be used for protein engineering purposes or to predict the function of orphan sequences based on the protein fold (using Dali or Foldseek).\nAs mentioned above, it also advisable to check the template structures and read the papers describing them in order to squeeze all the information from your model.\nWhat do you think you could use our models of NEIL2 and HAdV-2pol?"
